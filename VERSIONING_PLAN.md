### **Git and GitHub Version Control Best Practices Plan**

This document outlines a plan for implementing version control best practices using Git and GitHub. The goal is to improve code quality, streamline the development process, and enhance collaboration within a large software project.

#### **1. Branching Strategy: GitFlow**

We will adopt the GitFlow branching model, which provides a robust framework for managing a project with scheduled releases.

*   **`main` Branch:**
    *   This branch represents the production-ready code.
    *   Direct commits to `main` are strictly forbidden.
    *   Merges to `main` should only come from `release` branches or `hotfix` branches.
    *   Each merge to `main` should be tagged with a version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

*   **`develop` Branch:**
    *   This is the primary integration branch for new features.
    *   All feature branches are created from `develop` and merged back into it.
    *   The `develop` branch should always be in a state where it can be deployed to a staging or testing environment.

*   **Feature Branches (`feature/*`):**
    *   Created from the `develop` branch for new features or enhancements.
    *   Named using a consistent convention, such as `feature/user-authentication` or `feature/JIRA-123-new-api`.
    *   Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into `develop` via a pull request.

*   **Release Branches (`release/*`):**
    *   Created from the `develop` branch when it is time to prepare for a new release.
    *   Used for final testing, bug fixes, and documentation updates specific to the release.
    *   Once the release is ready, the `release` branch is merged into both `main` (and tagged) and `develop`.

*   **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`):**
    *   Created from the `main` branch to address urgent production issues.
    *   Once the fix is complete, the `hotfix` branch is merged into both `main` (and tagged with a patch version) and `develop`.

#### **2. Commit Guidelines**

*   **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should represent a single, logical change. This makes it easier to review, revert, and understand the project's history.
*   **Conventional Commits:** We will use the Conventional Commits specification for commit messages. This provides a standardized format that can be used to automate changelog generation and versioning.
    *   **Format:** `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
    *   **Example:** `feat(auth): implement user registration endpoint`
*   **Sign-off:** All commits should be signed off (`git commit -s`) to indicate that the committer has the right to submit the work and agrees to the project's license.

#### **3. Pull Requests (PRs)**

*   **PR Template:** A standardized PR template will be used to ensure that all necessary information is included, such as a description of the changes, testing performed, and any related issues.
*   **Code Reviews:** All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least two other developers before being merged.
*   **CI/CD Checks:** Automated checks (see section 4) must pass before a PR can be merged.

#### **4. Code Quality and Automation**

*   **Linters and Formatters:** Tools like ESLint, Prettier, and Ruff will be used to enforce a consistent code style and catch common errors.
*   **Pre-commit Hooks:** We will use pre-commit hooks (e.g., with Husky or pre-commit) to run linters, formatters, and other checks before a commit is created.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** A CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) will be set up to automatically run tests, builds, and other checks on every PR.

#### **5. Release Management**

*   **Semantic Versioning:** We will use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to version our releases (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
*   **Git Tags:** Git tags will be used to mark all releases on the `main` branch.
*   **Automated Changelog:** A changelog will be automatically generated from the commit messages using a tool like `standard-version`.

#### **6. GitHub Best Practices**

*   **Branch Protection:** The `main` and `develop` branches will be protected to prevent direct pushes and require PRs and passing CI checks before merging.
*   **Issue Tracking:** GitHub Issues will be used to track all bugs, feature requests, and other tasks.
*   **Project Boards:** GitHub Projects will be used for project management and to visualize the status of work.
*   **CODEOWNERS:** A `CODEOWNERS` file will be used to define which teams or individuals are responsible for different parts of the codebase.

#### **7. Training and Documentation**

*   **Onboarding:** New developers will be provided with training on the established version control workflow.
*   **Documentation:** The branching strategy, commit guidelines, and other best practices will be documented in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the project's repository.
